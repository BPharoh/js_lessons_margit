Step 1

Ask for the user's licence plate, car maker, car model, current owner, price and colour. 
Get the user input and create a new car object based on those properties
Make an array of added cars and show a console table with an array
Show array as a table on a webpage

Hints:

You could use class constructor (ES6) for the template of the car object: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_constructor_class.asp or Object.prototype.constructor https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_constructors.asp
Use an array to store your car objects.
Instead of using console.log(), try console.table(). 
For displaying an array as a table, use innerHTML. An example: https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/javascript/innerHTML+bind+table
 

Step 2

Create a function that allows the user to search for a specific car based on a license plate. 
When the licence plate is found, show on screen this car mark, model and owner.
