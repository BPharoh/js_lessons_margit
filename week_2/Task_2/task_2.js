//Evaluate the below:

3 + "65"               // 68, it concatenated
7 - "3"                // Performed substraction to give -4, treated 3 as a number
15 % 5                 // Gives me a  remainder =  0
5 % 15                 // Gives the original input as division was not possible
"Java" + "Script"      // Produceed the word Javascript
"Java" - "Script"      // Gave me nothing because they are not numbers
" " + " "              // Gives me a blank space
" " + 0                // Gives me a space plus the number zero
true + true            // Gives me 2, it treated true as a number 1
true + false           // Gives me 1, ittreated false as 0 and true as number 1
false + true           // Gives me 1, false is 0 and true is 1
false - true           // Gives negative 1, because falseis0 and true is 1
3 - 4                  // gives negative 1, it performed a substraction


//Evaluate the below comparisons:
4 >= 2                // true
6 === 2               // false
3 <= 1                // false
1 != 1                // false
"A" > "B"             // false ( It made a numeric comparision using their equivalent ASCII values)
"B" < "C"             // true  ( It made a numeric comparision using their equivalent ASCII values)
"a" > "A"             // true  ( It made a numeric comparision using their equivalent ASCII values)
"b" < "A"             // false ( It made a numeric comparision using their equivalent ASCII values)
true === false        // false
true != true          // false
